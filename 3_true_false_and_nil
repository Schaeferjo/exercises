puts # ------------ print empty line -------------
# So as you already found out in the last exercise, some methods return a so called boolean value, e.g.
puts "Asking 5.is_a?(Object) returns the value 'true' because the number 5 is an Object"
puts 5.is_a?(Object)
puts "But the number 5 is not a String, so asking 5.is_a?(String) returns"
puts 5.is_a?(String)
puts "But everything between quotation marks is a String, now if you ask me, this String, right here:"
puts "But everything between quotation marks is a String, now if you ask me, this String, right here:".is_a?(String)
# Both true and false are protected keywords in ruby, so you can't use them as a variable name
# This will lead into an error
# true = "Something"
puts # ------------ print empty line -------------


# There is another special value called 'nil' which represents just nothing, right, the nothingness ;)
# Sometimes a method returns nil, e.g. 'index' gives you the position of the first occurrence of a character
puts "The first occurrence of the character 'e' in 'Auslegeware' is at position"
puts "Auslegeware".index("e")
puts "Of course we start counting at 0, like this: 0,1,2,3,4... "
# But what happens if we search for a character which is not in the String?
puts "There is no character 'Z' in 'Auslegeware' so 'Auslegeware'.index('Z') will give us"
p "Auslegeware".index("Z")
puts # ------------ print empty line -------------
puts # ------------ print empty line -------------

puts "By the way, I've used the method 'p' to print the value 'nil' because if you use 'puts' with nil you see:"
puts nil
puts "An empty line! Does that make sense? You simply print nothing! :)"
