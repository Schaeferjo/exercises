# we can assign a variable with the equal sign =
a = "I am a String, and I am assigned to the variable 'a'"
# the right side gets 'assigned' to the variable on the left
b = "I am another String, and I am assigned to the variable 'b'"
# a variable is just an identifier, ie. a name
# variables are like a post-it to remember things

puts "We can recall a variable by it's name"
puts "So for example, if we want to show the string that we gave the name 'a'"
puts a


puts "Likewise, we can show the string associated with the variable 'b'"
puts # TODO: What do we have to type in here???
